Gabe's personal page

# Overview

This is my personal page created with react. The steps I want to follow are:
<ol>
  <li>Diagram what my page will look like</li>
  <li>Start React init to set up initial repo</li>
  <li>Start making making components</li>
  <li>Figure what data I will need, and posibly start with mock data, then use an actual database</li>
  <li>Launch that badboy on Heroku or AWS</li>
</ol>
