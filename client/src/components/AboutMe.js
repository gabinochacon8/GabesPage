          <h2>HELLO! üëãüèº</h2>
          <p>My name is Gabino Chacon, but everyone calls me Gabe. I really enjoy puzzles, video games, and sports; as I love to come up with solutions for every little thing. I have had many roles. The latest being Software Engineer. I think all of my past experiences have led me here. I have been a car and train mechanic(for GATX), door to door business salesman(for Intuit), warehouse/forklift worker, U.S. Marine(3521), mobile expert/retail sales associate, and college student.</p>

          <p>At the end of 2018 I decided to sell all of my possessions and travel the world for a year. I have visited a total of 31 countries, including military deployment. While in Peru, I met a person working off of their laptop at a hostel during breakfast. I asked what they did, and they responded that they work remotely, as a software engineer, for a start-up. I was amazed to find out that someone could be anywhere on the planet, as long as they have WiFi, and work/make money. I immediately looked online to see what it takes, and that was the moment I found my love for coding. I started learning JavaScript, Python, and MySQL on my own using Udemy and Codeacademy. Later I found out about Hack Reactor, and I haven't looked back since.</p>

          <p>Thank you for stopping by my page. Please take a look at my resume, and let me know if there are any solutions I can help with!</p>
