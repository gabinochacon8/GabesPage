          <h2>HELLO! üëãüèº</h2>
          <p>
            My name is Gabe. You killed my... oh wait wrong story. I am a Marine
            Veteran who found a love for coding in 2018 when solo traveling the
            world. I met a person working off of their laptop while eating
            breakfast at our hostel. I asked him what he did, and he told me he
            was a freelance software engineer for a startup company. I was
            immediately intrigued that while sipping his coffee in Peru, he was
            able to contribute to building a web application in the US. I had
            some exposure to coding in college, but I wasn't sure what path to
            take then. Inspired by the opportunity of software engineering, I
            took the initiative to learn how to code, and here I am.{" "}
