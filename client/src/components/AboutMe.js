            My name is Gabino, but I go by Gabe. I am a Marine Veteran who found a
            love for coding in 2018 when solo traveling the world. I am a full stack
            developer, and I can build apps from front to back. Currently I am learning
            Python, but I am fluent in Javascript. I really like to work with mobile
            applications, but I also love desiging web apps.
            <a href="#tech_skills" style={{color:'#f1f1f1'}}>{' '} My stack </a>
            listed above are most technologies I am comfortable with. I am also learning Django
            to better develop my backend skills.{"\n"}
          </p>

          <p>
            My education consists of a degree from National University in Computer Science
            and two bootcamps including Hack Reactor and PDX Code Guild. I am also
            constantly updating my knowlege using medium.com, YouTube, and various other
            media. This is truly my passion, and I am on my computer 80%
            of my day practicing what I know, and implementing everything with new apps.
            Although I am a junior developer, I can relentlessly solve any problem.
