          <h2>HELLO! üëãüèº</h2>
          <p>My name is Gabino Chacon, but everyone calls me Gabe. I am a Marine Veteran who found a love for coding in 2018 when solo traveling the world. While eating breakfast in a hostel in Peru, I met a person working off of their laptop. I asked him what he did, and he told me he was a freelance software engineer for a startup company. Unfamiliar with coding, I was immediately intrigued. While sipping his coffee in Lima, he was able to contribute to building a web application in the United States. Inspired by the opportunity of software engineering, I took the initiative to learn how to code. Today, I am a qualified Fullstack Engineer. </p>

          <p>Thank you for stopping by my page. Please take a look at my resume, and let me know if there are any solutions I can help with!</p>
